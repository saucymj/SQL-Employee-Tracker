# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

I made this backend project so that a business would be able to view departments, employees, and roles of their company. They have the ability to view all departments, view all roles, add employees, add departments, update a current employees role, and even see the budget of roles. I learned how to use sql properties inside of my js file instead of in the sql file (ex: "SELECT * FROM").

## Installation

Users will first have to run npm init -y and then npm install, to download all dependencies (mysql, inquirer, and console.table).

## Usage
